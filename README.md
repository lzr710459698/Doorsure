DoorSure is a smart garage door monitoring and control system designed to enhance home security, improve user convenience, and provide peace of mind. Developed as a capstone project by Group 22 at the University of Central Florida, DoorSure addresses a common homeowner concern: forgetting to close the garage door, a mistake that can lead to security risks and potential property damage. The system empowers users with real-time awareness and remote control over their garage door, anytime and anywhere.
